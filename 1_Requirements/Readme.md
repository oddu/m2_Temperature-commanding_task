# **Requirements**

## **Introduction**

This Project Vehicle Seat Heat Monitoring System is maintaining of heat in the vehicle seat. In the project sensor will sense the driver seated or not and if driver seated to need their required temperature. Contoller will set the heater to required temperature. The heater will be generates required heat and display the temperature in serial monitor.In project used ATmega328 microcontroller along with temperature sensor,Push button switch,LED,USART etc.

## **Features**

- The System will sense is driver seated or not.
- As per Drivers request, Heater will generate the heat accordingly.
- Low cost and robust system.

## **SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats**

### **Strengths**

- Easy to Contol.
- Easy to change the temperature inside the vehicles.

### **Weakness**

- Its only applicable for cold countries.Required Heating purpose.

### **Opportunities**

- It can be use as Heater.

### **Threats**

- Not Used in high temperature places.

## **4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H**

### **WHAT : Seat Temperature Monitoring System**

### **WHERE : Used in Automoblie industries**

### **WHEN : At low Temperature**

**HOW: Monitor the temperature in Serial Monitor**
